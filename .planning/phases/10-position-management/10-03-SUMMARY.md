# Phase 10 Plan 03: Register Positions Domain Summary

**35 position tools wired into MCP aggregator, bringing total to 310 tools with zero duplicates and clean build**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 1 min
- **Started:** 2026-03-03T20:36:12Z
- **Completed:** 2026-03-03T20:37:37Z
- **Tasks:** 1
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments
- Registered positions domain as 25th import in src/tools/index.ts
- All 35 position tools (7 types x 5 CRUD ops across quotes/orders/invoices) now discoverable via MCP
- Total tool count verified at 310 with zero duplicate names
- TypeScript build compiles clean with zero errors

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Register positions domain and verify build** - `5bff3dc` (feat)

**Plan metadata:** pending (docs: complete plan)

## Files Created/Modified
- `src/tools/index.ts` - Added positions import, spread into allDefinitions (35 tools) and allHandlers, updated total count comment from 275 to 310

## Decisions Made
None - followed plan as specified. Standard domain registration pattern used consistently with prior 24 domains.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered
None.

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- All 10 phases complete (33/33 plans executed)
- v2.2 milestone deliverables: 310 tools total (275 prior + 35 positions)
- Ready for version bump and publishing

## Self-Check: PASSED

- FOUND: src/tools/index.ts
- FOUND: commit 5bff3dc
