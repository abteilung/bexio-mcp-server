## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Mobile app | Web/desktop only for v2 |
| OAuth flow | API token is sufficient and simpler |
| Real-time webhooks | MCP is request/response, not push |
| Multi-company support | Single Bexio account per installation |
| Legacy timesheet API | Deprecated per Bexio docs |
| Custom caching | Stateless design for simplicity |
| SDK v2.0 (when released) | Build on stable v1.25.x, upgrade later |
