## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 6 phases derived from 67 requirements (Quick depth compression)
- [Roadmap]: FOUND-03/FOUND-04 assigned to Phase 5 (packaging after all tools)
- [Roadmap]: Payroll tools (PAY-*) conditional on Bexio module availability
- [Planning]: v1 has 83 tools (not 56 as initially documented) - updated all plans
- [Planning]: Zod pinned to exactly 3.22.5 (not ^3.22.0) to avoid v4 issues
- [Planning]: Wave structure: SDK (1) -> Architecture (2) -> Tools (3)
- [01-01]: SDK import from /server/mcp.js (not /server/index.js) per 1.25.2 convention
- [01-01]: All logging via console.error() to preserve stdout for JSON-RPC

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- ~~SDK migration from 0.5.0 to 1.25.2 has limited official documentation~~ RESOLVED in 01-01
- Swiss QR-invoice spec compliance needs research (Phase 2)
- MCP Apps (UI-*) based on SEP-1865 proposal, not yet stable (Phase 5 risk)
