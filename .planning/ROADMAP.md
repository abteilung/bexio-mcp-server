# Roadmap: Bexio MCP v2

## Overview

This roadmap transforms the v1 Bexio MCP server (83 tools, SDK 0.5.0, 2,418-line monolith) into a modern v2 distribution with one-click installation, complete API coverage, and modular architecture. The journey starts with SDK migration and architectural refactoring, expands to full Bexio API coverage across 8 feature domains, and culminates in MCPB packaging for zero-friction installation.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.

- [x] **Phase 1: Foundation & Migration** - SDK upgrade, modular architecture, existing 83 tools working
- [x] **Phase 2: Reference Data & Banking** - Foundational configuration data, Swiss banking/payments
- [x] **Phase 3: Projects & Accounting** - Time tracking, project management, chart of accounts, manual entries
- [x] **Phase 4: Purchase, Files & Payroll** - Bills, expenses, documents, HR (conditional)
- [ ] **Phase 5: UI & Packaging** - MCP Apps capability, MCPB bundle, npm package
- [ ] **Phase 6: Distribution** - MCP Registry, npm publish, GitHub release, documentation

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Foundation & Migration

**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md - SDK Migration: Upgrade to 1.25.2, fix breaking changes, pin Zod 3.22.x
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md - Modular Architecture: Create types/, shared/, tools/ structure with aggregation patterns
